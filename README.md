To run:

    On command prompt, go to balance_checking directory, run "./cucumber"

Example Output:

C:\test\balance>cucumber
Feature: Verify text fields and balance calculation
  As an end user
  I want to verify the right count of values appear on the screen
            verify the values on the screen are greater than 0
            verify the total balance is correct based on the values listed
            verify the values are formatted as currencies
            verify the total balance matches the sum of the values

  Scenario: Verify balance page                               # features/balance.feature:9
    Given I navigate to the page on Chrome                    # features/step_definitions/balance_steps.rb:1
    When the page is loaded                                   # features/step_definitions/balance_steps.rb:5
      Verify values appears
      Verify values are in currency format
      Verify values larger than 0
      Verify balance is right
    Then verify the text fields and total balance are correct # features/step_definitions/balance_steps.rb:9
      Total balance should be $997000.0, not $1000000.0 (RuntimeError)
